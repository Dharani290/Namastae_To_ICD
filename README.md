Healthcare Interoperability & Morbidity Code Mapping System

Bridging Traditional Indian Medicine with Global Healthcare Standards using FHIR & ICD-11

📖 About the Project

NAMASTE is a healthcare interoperability project designed to integrate and map morbidity codes from AYUSH systems (Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani) with international disease classification standards like ICD-11.

The system processes healthcare datasets, generates FHIR resources, and enables intelligent disease code matching for research, analytics, and digital health applications.

🎯 Key Objectives

🔗 Enable interoperability between traditional & modern medicine

🧾 Digitize AYUSH morbidity classifications

🔍 Provide disease search & code mapping

🧠 Build intelligent ICD ↔ NAMASTE match logic

📊 Generate FHIR-compatible healthcare datasets
